## **Planning Stage**

### **Target Audience:**

  * Anyone, young or grown who would like to test or expand on their general knowledge capacity.

### **User Stories:**

As a user, I would like to:

  * Have my score recorded and get a feedback at the end of each game. 
  * See the correct answer after i get a question wrong. 
  * Questions to be understandable and clear
  * See that a single game does not have too much questions. The number of questions should be short so not to make it boring and tiring.

### **Site Aims:**

1. To present a general knowledge quiz game that tests the user's general knowledge capacity.
2. To provide different levels of difficulties to make the quiz game fun and challenging. 
3. The site should be easy to navigate and instructions should be very clear.
4. To randomise questions so the questions are not the same anytime the user plays the same difficulty again.
4. To add a score counter on each game and display score feedback and text feedback on how they did at the end of the game. 
5. To add a countdown to answer each question so the user does not have time to google the answer if they don't know.
6. To become an entertaining and useful game that increases the user's general knowlegde capacity.
